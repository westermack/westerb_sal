1. Combine "store_albums" and "store_comments" into one "store_units" function
    and reexamine the need to store the data in JSON (hopefully Ray Villalobos' course
    on the subject should help here)

2. Create a CSS sprite of all UI background images and icons

3. CSS that only Chrome will see for the ul element that wraps radio buttons--
    it looks slightly off in my current version of Chrome

4. Run Y-Slow on the entire site and make changes as needed

5. Get back to all REVISIT cases in my code

6. Start sizing and positioning everything in relative terms in preparation for Responsive
    Design

7. "The Copied Text Problem": copied text will include other/extra new line characters that mess up
    the counting of remaining characters in textarea elements (this is captions, notes and comments)

8. Revisit the RegExp for sanitizing links included in captions, notes and comments

9. Get back to the "<=" problem and the general problem of escaping/encoding text from input fields
    for storing in the DB (hopefully Bill Weinman's SQL course should help here)

10. The |POST| button in the photo post comment area when counter < 10; not so pretty...

11. Styling the scroll element

12. Consider solving user injected HTML (XSS) with &gt and &lt replacement

13. The "loading_more" element in comment divisions can be made to center itself according to
    the containing td/tr element's width

14. Implement "Please wait a moment..." as album-group/photo-comment section messages displayed during
    scrolling when (westerb_sal.request_done !== true), as opposed to just ";"

15.Get back to: if(FORMDATA...) {...} **else if(FILE...) {...}** else {...}

16. "highlight_dialog()" can be made more efficient with code like $('#blinker').hide(100).show(100).hide(100).show(100)...

18. Make modal dialog boxes shrink and expand responsively-- same behaviour as alert boxes in Firefox

19. Re-examine "if(store)" in the code that handles hash changes

20. Add "JUST GO TO PUBLIC AREA" on the "login prompt" to afford the user the option to say "screw it, I don't wish to
    stay/go in Admin area any more...just keep/take me to the Public area"

21. One of the implications of relying on $(window).onload() to initially store the "#main" div state for the "public_index"
    page is that if the user copies and pastes a URL that's not the home page, a hash change that requests the home page
    might fail-- try: while logged in, copy ".../admin/index.php" into Firefox (new browser window) and then click
    |PUBLIC AREA|

22. Consider letting the user know that they can always quit the full screen view with an "ESC/F11". Also note: if the
    user goes full screen via manually pressing "F11", my footer is left hanging rather awkwardly-- in Firefox at least

24. Note that if "admin_index.php" is opened via "Open in a new window", clicking the "home" link would still change
    the hash and fetch the same page (examine this further)

DONE:

17. $(document).unbind('scroll') and $(window).unbind('resize') should unbind specific functions, otherwise could
    interfere with Responsive Design

23. It'd be cool to say "Thank you for your comment, Joe"...if the user provided a name when posting his comment

24. While editing the album name on 'list_albums.php', make suspend the hover-trigerring so that the name can be
    edited with less hustle!
