1. |PUBLIC AREA| does not work on the live site

2. Implement the album deletion algorithm ("$(.album).fadeTo(300, .5).delay(200).slide(300)"
    could be a nice visual-update effect here)

5. Implement the "logoff" module to clear everything and "beforeunload", to
    check whether there's an ongoing operation or not (to guard against cases when the
    user hits refresh at such moments), among other things ---------------------------------------PARTLY DONE

8. Revisit the "multiple-form-problem", especially vis-a-vis the "login prompt" (possible solutions:
    --add a "current_form" class/ --disable the form underneath/ --USE AN IFRAME. Also note: the
    "login prompt" comes up when my local server is turned off...are the implications of this desirable?

9. Get back to the problem of non-temporary sessionStorage in IE

10. Implement multiple file submission, in both AJAX (drag-and-drop API) and plain HTML/PHP API. Also
    generalize the file submission code in form.js to work for any number of files and any type

11. Application's AJAX navigation fails/misbehaves when user navigates with the backspace button and
    the browser's back and forward buttons. Also, tjough not as urgently, modify the "<< Back" behaviour
    to be able to restore the exact application state that went before, subject to modification taking place
    in the current page, of course. (possible solution: HTML5 History Management API)

12. Revisit $(document).scroll(reposition_box), especially in IE, when the window has been
    shrunk down-- a weird sideways scroll occurs

13. Revistit the fixed width of the noscript message

14. Consider rewriting all modules that perform AJAX requests without jQuery's assistance.
    This will help to deal with request timeout scenarios

15. With the help of jQuery's live events, the application ought to be able to restore album and photo sets
    even if notes boxes/comments sections are open

16. Implement custom tooltips

17. Implement the custom contextmenu

18. Play a short sound along with highlighting the "blocking dialog"

19. Validate login status before every AJAX operation that requires login access???

20. Heigh/width measurements for "preview available" elements are slightly off, causing ugly slight element
    shifting

21. Get back to the problem of responsively readjusting image dimensions as the browser shrinks and
    expands (also loading images with dimensions that take into account the browser's resolution, e.g
    my current Firefox vs. the rest. In the same vein, REMEMBER: for albums on "public_index.php" (maybe
    elsewhere, too) the layout obscures content in a 1024px-wide (thereabout, and less) viewport of
    as only ane album per row gets shown)-- a problem that I believe can be solved with CSS3's Media Queries

22. Any uncleared Timeouts/Intervals from pages that set them while making it "impossible" to clear, clear
    them during # changes??? (e.g, the Interval timer at "photo_upload.php" when the file selection window is
    opened, a photo selected (initiates the validation Interval calls), but the user decides not to upload the photo)

23. Get back to "clear_outer_wrapper_state()"

24. Use "westerb_sal.request_done" while animating full screen to limit user fast clicks???

25. Allow going back to "main-home" if a_id/p_id/c_set are set in the URL, in case these "pages" are accessed
    via the address bar. ALTERNATIVELY: use JS to always redirect to "main-home" in such cases

26. Add appropriate hash removing classes to elements on Normal's "list_albums" page

27. The PHP time stamp is off

28. Change implementation of thumbnail previews to:
    function showPrev(input) {
        if (input.files && input.files[0]) {
            var reader = new FileReader();
            reader.onload = function(e) {
                $('#avatar-preview').attr('src', e.target.result).parent().nailthumb();
            };
            reader.readAsDataURL(input.files[0]);
        }
    }

DONE:

0. TEST: Logout is now acting up...

*****1. Change photo error strings to more user-friendly UI messages (still few unfriendly messages left, though)******

3. Implement the last "big one"

4. Get back to the "post-AJAX-navigation-BACK-TO" problem

6. Select and start preparing the albums that will go in the live application.
    Possibilities: --The Salon Project (an exhibition of the code used in The Salon)
                   --Headshots
                   --Exhibitionist Art
                   --Tingatinga Art
                   --Cubism Art
                   --Van Ghogh...

7. CSS to prevent words of long photo captions and album notes from being cut mid-way
