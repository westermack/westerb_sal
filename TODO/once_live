1. Test if the cur_pg RegExps still behave as expected

2. Watch closely the consequences of allowing Guest to change album cover

3. Watch all instances of "stalltime" to see how they perform live, as pages and AJAX-loaded
    scripts take more time to download

4. REMEMBER: change "westerb_sal.dev_mode", "westerb_sal.HOME" in JS and the "HOME" definition in PHP

5. Configure the php.ini file to disable error reporting and also to allow bigger files to be uploaded
    (at least this is what I suppose explains the crushes that happen whenever I try uploading files > 17MB)

7. Watch the 1000ms delay to initiate the "login watch"...might need to lower it depending on how long the $.get()
    function called in "westerb_sal.check_login()" on every page refresh takes when the calls are now made to the
    remote server

8. Consider using Google's CDN for jQuery ('1' for latest version < 2)

10. Watch the 20000ms timeout setup in "jQuery.ajaxSetup"-- might be too short

11. Add 'index.php' to 'public/ajax', 'public/images', 'public/layouts' for a 401/403

DONE:

6. What of the case scripts loaded via $.getScript(...) load too long and meanwhile the "#main" div is still
    invisible (possible solution: a combination of $'s timeouts, the UI ellipses and the try/catch block-- throw
    an exception on a timeout and display the content anyways with a UI message to inform the users of the failure
    to download the scripts)-- Solved mostly with "live events"

9. Remove/comment out all instances of "console.log()"-- SOLVED WITH MINIFICATION
